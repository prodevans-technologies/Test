    "readme": "# vega-dataflow\n\nReactive dataflow processing.\n\nDefines a reactive dataflow graph that can process both scalar values and\nstreaming relational data. A central `Dataflow` instance manages and\nschedules a collection of `Operator` instances, each of which is a node in\na dataflow graph. Each operator maintains a local state *value*, and may\nalso process streaming data objects (or *tuples*) passing through. Operators\nmay depend on a set of named `Parameters`, which can either be fixed values\nor live references to other operator values.\n\nUpon modifications to operator parameters or input data, changes are\npropagated through the graph in topological order. `Pulse` objects propagate\nfrom operators to their dependencies, and carry queues of added, removed\nand/or modified tuples.\n\nThis module contains only the core reactive dataflow processing engine.\nOther modules provide a library of `Operator` types for data stream query\nprocessing, including data generation, sampling, filtering, binning,\naggregation, cross-stream lookup, visual encoding, and spatial layout.\n\nFor more information about data stream transforms, see the\n[Vega transform documentation](https://vega.github.io/vega/docs/transforms/).\n",
