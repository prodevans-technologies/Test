    "readme": "# jupyterlab-hub\n\n[JupyterLab](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab) integration for\n[JupyterHub](https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub).\n\nThis adds a \"Hub\" menu to JupyterLab that allows a user to log out of JupyterHub\nor access their JupyterHub control panel. This follows the JupyterLab extension system where an extension is just an npm package, not wrapped\nin a Python package.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n* JupyterLab.\n* A properly configured JupyterHub.\n\n## Installation\n\n### Setup user environment\n\nTo install the extension, run:\n\n```bash\njupyter labextension install @jupyterlab/hub-extension\n```\n\nNote that if JupyterHub is served under a sub-directory (for instance `/jupyter`), you will need to pass this information to JupyterLab via `page_config.json`. In an Anaconda installation, this file should be created at `/path/to/anaconda/share/jupyter/lab/settings/page_config.json`. \n\nExample contents of `page_config.json`:\n```json\n{\n    \"hub_prefix\": \"/jupyter\"\n}\n```\n\n### Configure JupyterHub's Spawner to start JupyterLab\n\nConfigure JupyterHub's Spawner to start with a JupyterLab that is aware of the JupyterHub by using a `jupyterhub_config.py` with the following entry:\n\n```\nc.Spawner.cmd = ['jupyter-labhub']\n```\n\n## Development\n\nFor a development install (requires npm version 4 or later), do the following in the repository directory:\n\n```bash\nnpm install\njupyter labextension link .\n```\n\nTo rebuild the package and the JupyterLab app after making changes:\n\n```bash\nnpm run build\njupyter lab build\n```\n",
