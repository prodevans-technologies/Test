    "readme": "# react\n\nAn npm package to get you immediate access to [React](https://reactjs.org/),\nwithout also requiring the JSX transformer. This is especially useful for cases where you\nwant to [`browserify`](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify) your module using\n`React`.\n\n**Note:** by default, React will be in development mode. The development version includes extra warnings about common mistakes, whereas the production version includes extra performance optimizations and strips all error messages.\n\nTo use React in production mode, set the environment variable `NODE_ENV` to `production`. A minifier that performs dead-code elimination such as [UglifyJS](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2) is recommended to completely remove the extra code present in development mode.\n\n## Example Usage\n\n```js\nvar React = require('react');\n```\n",
